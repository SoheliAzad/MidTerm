Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. programming language is computer friendly language to receive, store, process and retrieve data/instructions
from the computer as per the user need. For an example, Java is a programming language.


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. Java Development kit (JDK) is a software development environment and is used to run Java applications in it.
Along with few other things, mainly it consist of the following:

Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Set of software tools to develop java application
Java Interpreter and loader: It interpretes and translates computer language (bytecode) into human readable langauge
Java Compiler (Javac):it creates bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
Java Archive (JAR): it is pacakged into Zip files to use many files aggregating into one
Java Documentation Generator (Javadoc): documentation generator for generating API documentation in HTML format


What is IDE?
A. IDE is Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application used for software developement.


What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. There are quite a few number of IDEs available to support java, like Eclipse, Intellij, NetBeans, blueJ etc.


Explain the entire java lifecycle.
A. The java life cycle starts from code/text editor and goes to java compiler. Java compiler compiles the codes
 into bytecode. Bytecodes are processed into the JVM through class loader and interpreter and with the help of
 JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Finally it used by dirfferent operating systems.

what is class?
A. Class is a blueprint from which an object is created. The structure of Class is:
[access specifier] [Class keyword] [class name]{
constructor
variables
methods
}


What is object?
A. Object is the instances/mirror image of class.


What is the entry point of an application?
A. 'Main' method (public static void main(String[]args) is the entry point of any application in java.


Why main is static?
A. As main the entry point of any java application, it is static to execute the first command in any given point of time.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object class is the superclass of all classes in java.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path: Environment variable for the operating system to implement executables.
Class path: Environment variable to find path of class. It is used by Java compiler.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface Class: only method can be declared without any method body
   Abstract Class: Non abstract method can be implemented and abstract method can be declared.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No object can be made from an Interface and Abstract class. They can be used in a full fledged class with
'extend' keyword.


what is Access Specifier?
A. Access Specifier, as its name suggests, specifies who should have access to that particular class.
In a class with 'public' keyword as access speficier, all have access to that class.
'Private' and 'protected' class are not accessed by all but can be accessed from within that particular class only.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP is Object Oriented Programming. It is based on object and data. There are four types of OOP as follows:
Abstraction: Implementation hiding. It is implemented with the help of class, objects and variables from other class.

Encapsulation: data hiding. It reduces the functionality without compromising the security by using getter and setter
methods from a private class.

Inheritance: allows classes to adopt/get the properties of another class by using 'extend' keyword. The original class is called Parent class
and the class that uses the properties of another class is called sub/child class.

Polymorphism: An object taking on many forms. It adovocates the fact that a class can extend more than one class at a time.
Method overriding and method overloading are examples of polymorphism.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. Java package is the grouping of classes, interfaces, enum etc that provide access and name space management.
Java.lang.package is the default package.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API is Application Programming Interface. We have used java API like import.java.util.scanner, import.java.util etc.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java does not support multiple inheritance. Because it leads to ambiguity and confusions.


What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method overloading allows a class to have more than one methods having the same name.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Exceptions are error or roadblocks that appear during program run time. It is ususally handle with 'try' and 'catch'
 method.
 Structure of the method:
 try{


 } catch (Exception Name e1){
//catch block
 }


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.



What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?


What is final, finally and finalize?


What is a constructor ?
A. Constructor is a special method to initialize an object. It usually has the same name as Class name.
Structure of constructor:
[access specifier] [same name as lcass name](){

}

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes we can have multiple constructors in a class.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. Default constructor is called during object creation, if no constructor is declared.


What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. 'This' keyword is a referencne variable to refer current object. It is used to refer instance variable,
invoke constructor etc.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?


What is JVM stand for ?
A. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.


Is JVM platform independent?
A. Yes.


What version of java are you using?
A. "11.0.1"


What is JAR stand for ?
A. JAR is Java Archive.
