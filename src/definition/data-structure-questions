Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. We need data structure to access, organize and modify our data in the computer as per our need.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. There are different operations that can be performed in the data structure:
Insertion: to add items
Deletion: to remove items
Modification: to change or modify items
Searching: to search a particular item
Sorting: to sort data in a desired/given order


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Data structures are applied extensively in areas like graphics, operating systems, database management system,
compiler design etc.


what is an Array?
A.  Array is a data container that holds numerous data of the same type.


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. The main difference between Array and ArrayList is Array is a fixed length data structure and ArrayList is variable
length collection class.


what is LinkedList?
A. LinkedList is a linear data structure, it uses doubly linked list to store elements.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Each element in Array is independent. They can be accessed using their index value, whereas in linkedList, each element
or node is connected and dependent on its next or previous node.


what is queue?
A. Queue is an interface. It is available in Java.util package. It is an insertion tool that inserts element at the end
of the queue and removes at from the beginning of the queue.


what is stack?
A. Java stack is memory that is used for execution of a thread.


what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO is based on the principle that first element is removed first and last element gets removed last. It is used in Queue.
LIFO is based on the principle of Last In First Out. It is used in Stack.


what is the order of complexity?
A.


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.


what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.


what is tree in data structure?
A. A tree is a non linear data structure.


what is graph in data structure?
A. A graph is also a non-linear data structure. It uses nodes and edges. It is a widely used data structure.


what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. HashTable is a synchronized method and HashMap is not a synchronized method. HashTable does not allow null keys or values,
HashMap allows one null key.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. The major data structures used in the following areas are:
RDBMS uses Array;
Network data model uses graph;
Hierarchical data model uses tree.


How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
